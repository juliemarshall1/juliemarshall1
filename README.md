👋 Hello there! I'm Julie Meg Marshall, a seasoned IT infrastructure, network, and systems engineer with over a decade of experience in the field. I currently serve as a Cloud Computing Engineer at SoundWay Consulting Inc., where I specialize in operational technology (OT) security and support solutions for automation and control technologies.

🛠️ My skill set includes proficiency in managing distributed control systems (DCS), programmable logic controllers (PLCs), and SCADA systems. I'm also a certified AWS expert, holding multiple AWS certifications, including AWS Certified Security - Specialty, AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate, and AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner.

🔒 Security is at the core of my work. I'm well-versed in AWS Security Reference Architecture and have a strong focus on operations and maintenance. I've led security-focused customer engagements, conducted comprehensive security assessments, and developed effective remediation plans. My knack for creating and maintaining meticulous documentation ensures clarity and transparency throughout the engagement process.

🔌 Beyond security, I'm adept at configuring production systems across different layers of the OSI model. My approach prioritizes maintaining the principle of least privilege while minimizing user and production impacts. My ultimate goal is to instill confidence in complex environments where system discovery and gap analysis are essential, leading to the implementation of staged improvements that result in resilient and stable OT systems.

💡 Passionate about technology and its transformative potential, I'm always eager to collaborate, learn, and share insights within the IT and cybersecurity communities.

🌐 Connect with me to explore the intersection of IT infrastructure, cloud computing, and cybersecurity. Let's build secure and robust systems together!
